# Personal-study-guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created by me after i completed the prework study guide for the boot camp, it contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
 I have created this personal study guide so that i could redesign the css and html of the project to futher practise coding and using git to update code as i struggled with the correct way to upload changes with git.
