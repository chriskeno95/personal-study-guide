# Personal-study-guide

## Description

This Personal Prework Study Guide was created by me after i completed the prework study guide for the boot camp, it contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
 I have created this personal study guide so that i could redesign the css and html of the project to futher practise coding and using git to update code as i struggled with the correct way to upload changes with git.
 For this project i have added Javascript creeated bt "Zinotrust". I used his code for creating a "my notes" application in the browser using local storage. 
 Initially i thought that i could create seperate pages for each of my notes and that the local storage for each page would then contain the html notes, and css notes etc. however ive learned that the local storage does not work that way/i do not yet now how to use Javascript so that this could work.
 I have noticed that there is an issue with the edit notes function when there are more than 1 note saved. This will hopefully be fixed by me in the furure.

## Usage
To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

To use the notes section, navigate to the page that you want to use (i.e learn html). Here you can type notes for the subject you are learning. simply type html as the title then add your html notes in the "note details box".
